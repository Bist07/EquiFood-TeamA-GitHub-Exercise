Maven structured app that asks the user to input integers separated by spaces (eg: "1 2 5 7 3") then returns a sorted list of the numbers. After the integers are added, the user is prompted for a modification. The modifications are as follows: <br/>
    0 - Returns sorted array <br/>
    1 - Returns sorted array in reverse order <br/>
    2 - Returns sorted array of odd numbers <br/>
    3 - Returns sorted array of even numbers <br/>
    4 - Returns sorted array of prime numbers: This function loops through the users inputed list and checks to ensure the number is prime. If the number is not prime it is removed from the list.  <br/>
